To Do:
  
  - new:
	- add sounds, take some from mr NOT?
	- if switch to hand tracking, teleport in front of dialog so u can play with hands
	- add virtual gamepad
	- support AR by just showing the sir and the button, and u just appear in front like the hand tracking, and also disable locomotion

  - dialog:
	- when u win the sir could say that he feels the urge to credit Robin and Pipo
		- after that he say that he will push the button anyway and ask you to pretend it will be the first time (restart)
	
  - changes:
	- find a better font
    - add win event to dialog (remove win if zero speed)
	- good and bad event change speed from an array of preselected ones, no more multiplier

  - adjustements:
	- make font color more readable
	- remove shadows from particles
	- make a prettier hand (also use it for player and make it a bit smaller)
	- try to pause music instead of restart after explosion
	- 

  - bugs: 
	- events are triggered again when the dialog is resumed
	- for the star dome bug, check the angle between the vertical and the horizontal, close to 90 is top or bottom
	
  extra:
	- for a trailer, u can have a quick playthrough where u select the bad option and it ends super quick, and then it types the title after the explosion
	- one of the stars is a wondermelon

	
Hard To Do:

  - the explode button hand gpoing down could be using physx not kinematic, no gravity , with a down linea velocity always set at frame time
	- this way u can block it with your hand or push it up again
	- at some point, if u block it for too long, he will say he has another secret explode button anyway
	- lock the hand on the y axis and maybe out an invisible block think to avoid being able to push it up infinetely (even though that may not be needed since u are not infinetely tall
	- he could also increase the multiplier speed because u are making him pissed cause of this
  
  
Done:
  
  - create simple scene with the gentle man, the button and the hand
  - the button is a physx collision and u have a trigger on bot your hand and the gentle man hand
	- if it overlaps the earth explode
  - add a basic game flow so that u have a start (with fade) and end screen (explosion) and a win state (earth view for longer but then u hear the click and explodes)
	- it restarts after that
  - add close detection when facing the gentle man and show a cube for now just as a placeholder
  - add the hand going down over time with a multiplier
	- the hand is always going no matter what, u can just make it go slower or faster by picking the right/wrong answer
  - hide the webxr hands when on the earth view + activate fly
  - add pulse when pressing buttons
  - add that if the pose is invalid the hands should 

  - multiply the speed if the dialog is visible
  - increase/decrease speed based on respone
